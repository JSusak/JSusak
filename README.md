## üìÑ Experiences/Hobbies

- I have done work experience at **Gatwick Airport**, shadowing the head of procurement and gaining insght into the daily tasks of someone with extremely high levels of responsibility.
- I have participated in an introductory course at an RAF reserves base. Learnt practical skills like reading maps and navigating to areas using a compass, as well as learning about the history of aircraft.
- In sixth form, I have devised an academic report based on the **quantum effects of black holes**, which allowed me to gain hands-on experience with topics outside the field of CS.
- **Keyboard building** is a niche hobby of mine and I am constantly looking for group buys/artisans which pique my interest. One day I aim to fill my whole number row with artisans! My favourites are [Jelly Key](https://www.jellykey.com/) and [Dwarf Factory](https://www.dwarf-factory.com/).
- Whenever I have the time I enjoy playing rhythm games, mainly [osu! (+taiko/mania)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8028288) and [quaver](https://quavergame.com/).

### Sports take up a huge chunk of my time:

- When I was younger I was part of **globe rowing club** and went to many regattas in locations such as **Maidstone** and **Eton Dorney**. Travelled to **Greenwich** for indoor training and the **Royal Albert Docks** for going on the water. Came second in my age group at the NJIRC. These days I try to get on the ergometer at least twice a week to improve my 2k.
- Went to **Fusion Table Tennis club**, attended many booster sessions to improve my overall skill. Was an enjoyable side hobby to fill time after school.
- My main sports right now are **bouldering** (have been going to **The Arch** three times a week for a few months now), **cycling** (best mode of transportation) and **yoga** (to stretch after the climbing!!).
